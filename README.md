# Advent-of-code-2024-in-Rust
Rust implementation of exercises from Advent of Code 2024. Because of [Advent of Code licence](https://adventofcode.com/about#legal) I can't post input files, so to run any given solution you need to:

1. Copy input file from Advent of Code website to directory for this day e.g. get input file from [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) for day01 and put it in `/day01/`
2. Open terminal in `/day01/` and run `cargo run`
